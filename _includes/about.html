      <h2>About</h2>
      <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
	<i>Wallace</i> is a modular, R-based platform for reproducible modeling of species niches and distributions.
	The application guides users through a complete analysis, from the acquisition of data to visualizing model
        predictions on an interactive map, thus bundling complex workflows into a single, streamlined interface.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
	<i>Wallace</i> is <b>open</b>: the code is free to use and modify (GPL 3.0), and it gives users access to
	some of the largest public online biodiversity databases. The application is <b>expandible</b>, as users
	can author and contribute modules that enable new methodogical options. There are <b>flexible</b> options
	for user uploads and downloads of results. The session is <b>interactive</b>, with an embedded
	zoomable map, sortable tables, and assorted visualizations of results. <i>Wallace</i> is instructive,
	with guidance text throughout that educates users about theoretical and analytical aspects of each
	step in the workflow. Lastly, it is <b>reproducible</b>, as users can download an R Markdown file
	that reruns the analysis.</p>

      <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
	<i>Wallace</i> is written using the web app development R package <span style="font-family:'Courier New">shiny</span>.
	Development requests or contributions should be directed to either the Github repo or the Google Group forum
	(links above).</p>

      <h3>Tutorials and Vignettes</h3>
      <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
	For a tutorial, please see our new <a href="vignettes/wallace_vignette.html" target="_blank">vignette</a> for version 1.0.5.
	This vignette has lots of images, which makes the file size too big for CRAN, so we are hosting it here instead.
      <p style="font-size:20px" align="left">
	A brief <a href="https://cmerow.github.io/RDataScience/3_4_wallace.html" target="_blank">vignette</a> outlining how to construct
	and add modules was presented at the 8th Biennial Conference of the International Biogeography Society in January 2017,
	during a workshop entitled "Integrating and cleaning biodiversity data: Workflows to model ranges and merge
	associated ecological, phylogenetic, and trait information" led by Dr. Cory Merow.</p>
